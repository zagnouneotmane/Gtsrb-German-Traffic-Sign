We will define the architecture of our implemented model that we has created and then we will apply this model on the basis of GTSR images. For this, we will work with the Tensorflow and Keras libraries for learning and classification. In order to improve the performance of the models and facilitate work, we will use some simple and effective techniques such as data augmentation and dropout. We will also give information such as how much how long does it take to train and how much data of each class is necessary to have a good classification model. Like any process of machine learning model creation, we will perform the steps defined below:

* Explore and visualize the dataset.

* Preprocess and augment the dataset, if necessary.

* Develop a CNN model.

* Train and validate the model.

* Optimize the model by experimenting with different hyperparameters.

* Test the model with the test dataset.
